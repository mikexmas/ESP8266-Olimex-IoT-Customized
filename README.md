# ESP8266-Olimex-IoT-Customized
Based on Olimex's ESP8266 IoT (https://github.com/OLIMEX/ESP8266) with some additional features and drivers.
I try to keep consistency and just add features.

All additional devices are customizable via JSON config strings.

Features:
- DIO (Digital Input & Outputs)
- DHTxx
- PING (measure distance)
- ADC (customizable)
- APP level Settings

Posible to configure to send data to ThingSpeak.
